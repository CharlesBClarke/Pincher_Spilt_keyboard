# Pincher\_Split\_keyboard (WIP)

The **Pincher Split Keyboard** is a work-in-progress split mechanical keyboard with a twist: the thumb cluster is positioned underneath the main keys.

The design philosophy is based on the natural motion of the human thumb — it's more comfortable for thumbs to pinch toward the fingers rather than push forward in the same direction.
